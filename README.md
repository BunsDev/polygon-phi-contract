# What is Phi

Phi is a protocol for creating an open Metaverse.
Blockchain's fairness, openness, and network effects. So we are trying to adopt these blockchain features into Metaverse. Phi is a completely new bottom-up Metaverse that everyone can participate in, extend, connect, and edit. Phi adopts Internet mechanisms to the Metaverse, creating a standard of value that is independent of the size and location of the land and stimulating user creativity.
